b304cee41|coolsnowwolf|Wed Feb 4 13:21:10 2026 +0800|arm64: dts: rockchip: Move dsi address+size-cells from SoC to rk3399 boards The #address-cells and #size-cells properties are not useful on the DSI controller node; they are only useful/required on ports and panel(s). So remove them from the controller node and add them where actually needed on the various rk3399 based boards.
